## Computational pipelines for processing and analysis of LINCS RNA-seq data

The purpose of this repository is to manage and expose the computational pipelines used to process and analyze RNA-seq data generated by the LINCS project. The plan is for each LINCS DSGC and DCIC to have their directory where they can organize their pipelines.

To get started, DCIC has created two computational pipelines. 
* The R-based pipeline in the form of a simple annotated R script and in the form of a R markdown script along with the produced pdf file. 
  * All files related to this pipeline are in the DCIC directory ([https://github.com/dcic/RNA-seq-pipelines/tree/master/DCIC](https://github.com/dcic/RNA-seq-pipelines/tree/master/DCIC)).
  * Filled in form description of the pipeline is in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B8e85FuoGaW3epeClo_ifKHfK-ovRhf6zlbZrvU6iFk/edit#).
* The other is a pipeline in a form of a Python Jupyter notebook which can be accessed here:Â [http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaayanLab/Zika-RNAseq-Pipeline/blob/master/Zika.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MaayanLab/Zika-RNAseq-Pipeline/blob/master/Zika.ipynb).
